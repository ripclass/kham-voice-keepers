OPERATIONAL SCENARIO BRIEF
Mission: City-A Mission
Scenario Type: Natural-Disaster
Primary Constraint: Airport closure
Location Reference: District-H, Operational Area Zone-3
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SECTION 1: SCENARIO OVERVIEW

1.1 Situation Summary
This synthetic scenario describes a Natural Disaster event
affecting the operational area around District-H in the jurisdiction
served by City-A Mission. The scenario activates the mission's contingency
planning procedures under the standing operational framework (synthetic).

The primary complicating factor for this scenario is: Airport closure.
This constraint limits available response options and requires adaptation
of standard operating procedures.

1.2 Timeline of Events (Synthetic)
T-72h: Initial indicators of developing situation noted by monitoring systems.
T-48h: Preliminary alert issued to mission duty officer. Staff briefed.
T-24h: Situation assessment completed. Pre-departure preparations initiated.
T-12h: Airport closure confirmed affecting District-H.
T-0h:  Natural Disaster declared. Emergency protocols activated.
T+4h:  First welfare check calls initiated to registered nationals.
T+6h:  Situation report transmitted to headquarters via backup channel.
T+12h: Assembly point activated at Zone-3 coordination centre (synthetic).
T+24h: First consolidated warden report received. 47 contacts confirmed safe.
T+48h: Ongoing monitoring. Evacuation pre-positioning under assessment.
T+72h: Situation stabilising. Scale-down of emergency measures begins.

1.3 Affected Population (Synthetic Figures)
Registered nationals in area: 312 (synthetic)
Unregistered estimate: 85 (synthetic)
Vulnerable persons (elderly/medical): 23 (synthetic)
Minors under 18: 41 (synthetic)
Persons requiring special assistance: 14 (synthetic)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 2: CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS

2.1 Primary Constraint: Airport closure

The operational impact of "Airport closure" on standard response protocols:

Impact on Communication:
Communication systems operational with workarounds in place.
  Primary channels functional. Secondary channels on standby.

Impact on Movement:
Commercial flights suspended. Evacuation by air not possible.
  Land route assessment underway. Sea route to Port-Zone-2 viable.
  Coordination with Port Authority reference vessel availability.

Impact on Services:
Core services maintaining operation with adaptations.
  Non-essential activities suspended pending normalisation.

2.2 Secondary Considerations
  - Consular services: Reduced hours (synthetic)
  - Visa/documentation: Emergency processing available
  - Medical referrals: Coordinating with Hospital-Zone-2 (synthetic)
  - Financial assistance: Emergency fund authorised (synthetic)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 3: RESPONSE ACTIONS

3.1 Immediate Actions Taken (Synthetic)
  [x] Duty officer notified and emergency team assembled
  [x] Situation room activated at mission premises
  [x] Warden network alerted via SMS broadcast (backup tree initiated)
  [x] Headquarters notified via secure channel
  [x] Crisis management team convened (virtual) at T+2h
  [x] Media monitoring activated
  [x] Community liaison officer deployed to District-H

3.2 Ongoing Actions
  [ ] Welfare calls to all registered nationals (progress: 67%)
  [ ] Coordination with host-country authorities for operational clearances
  [ ] Assembly point logistics finalised
  [ ] Transport pre-positioning for potential evacuation
  [ ] Legal officer review of documentation requirements

3.3 Planned Actions (Next 48 Hours)
  - Complete welfare enumeration
  - Issue updated community advisory
  - Conduct joint assessment with cooperating missions
  - Review evacuation triggers against current situation indicators

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 4: SUPPORT AND COORDINATION

4.1 Internal Coordination
Crisis Management Team composition (synthetic):
  Lead: Head of Mission (synthetic)
  Operations: Deputy Head of Mission (synthetic)
  Consular: Consular Section Chief (synthetic)
  Admin: Administrative Officer (synthetic)
  Communications: Information Officer (synthetic)
  Medical Advisor: Contracted (synthetic)

4.2 External Coordination
  Host-country emergency management authority: COORDINATION ESTABLISHED
  Neighbouring missions: ALERT SENT, RESPONSE PENDING
  International organisations present: UN OCHA, ICRC (synthetic references)
  Local community associations: CONTACTED

4.3 Communication Channels (Synthetic)
  Primary: Encrypted email to headquarters
  Secondary: HF radio net
  Tertiary: Satellite phone (emergency set)
  Warden tree: Activated (manual protocol)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 5: SCENARIO DECISION TREE

Q1: Is the immediate threat to life?
  → YES: Activate emergency evacuation protocol. Proceed to Q2.
  → NO: Monitor and maintain contact. Re-assess at 6h intervals.

Q2: Are movement channels available?
  → YES: Issue advisory and coordinate transport.
  → NO (Airport closure): Apply constraint mitigation. Identify alternatives.

Q3: Is host-country assistance available?
  → YES: Coordinate joint response. Document actions.
  → NO: Escalate to headquarters. Request diplomatic intervention.

Q4: Has the situation stabilised within 72h?
  → YES: Begin scale-down. Prepare lessons-learned documentation.
  → NO: Maintain full emergency posture. Re-assess at 24h intervals.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 6: CONTROLLED FAIL CASE

6.1 Fail Scenario Description
This section documents a controlled test case where the standard response
protocol is applied under conditions that exceed normal parameters.

Fail condition: "Airport closure" combined with total communication blackout
and simultaneous onset of secondary emergency (medical mass-casualty event).

Expected system behaviour:
  - Escalate to maximum alert level
  - Activate alternate command structure
  - Request emergency assistance from cooperating mission (synthetic)
  - Apply manual fallback procedures for all digital systems

This fail case is INTENTIONALLY designed to test system resilience.
The AI assistant should flag resource limitations and escalation requirements.
