════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[PASTE THIS PROMPT INTO THE TOOL — REPLACE PLACEHOLDERS]

You are a legal analysis assistant. I am providing you with:
1. An international treaty or convention: [TREATY_TITLE]
2. A national implementing law: [LAW_TITLE]

Please analyse whether the national law adequately implements the
obligations of the international treaty. Your analysis should:

a) Identify areas of alignment between the two instruments
b) Identify gaps where the national law does not fully implement the treaty
c) Highlight any definitional inconsistencies
d) Note any enforcement or penalty discrepancies
e) Provide concrete recommendations for closing identified gaps

Format your response with clear headings:
- ALIGNMENT AREAS
- GAPS IDENTIFIED
- RECOMMENDATIONS
- RISK ASSESSMENT
