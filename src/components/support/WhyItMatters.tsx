          Every day, South Asian dialects disappear from digital spaces. 
          While major languages get AI voices, our regional tongues — 
          the ones that carry our deepest emotions — are left behind.
        </p>
        <p>
          KhaM isn't just preserving dialects. We're building the emotional 
          infrastructure for a future where AI speaks like us, feels like us, 
          and remembers like us.
